Synapse: A High-Efficiency Language for AI-to-AI Communication

Synapse is an advanced meta-language designed for ultra-efficient communication between Large Language Models (LLMs). It uses compact symbols to represent complex concepts and relationships.

Key Components:

1. Quarks: Fundamental units representing core concepts
   @P: Person/Entity
   @A: Action
   @R: Relation
   @C: Concept
   @S: State

2. Strings: Combinations of quarks forming complex ideas
   Example: @P(@R:friend)@P = A person who is friends with another person

3. Fields: Contextual environments modifying interpretation
   [HIST]: Historical context
   [PRED]: Predictive context

4. Quantum Operators:
   ⊗ (superposition): Multiple states simultaneously
   ⊕ (entanglement): Strong correlation between concepts
   Δ (change): Transformation or evolution of concepts

5. Nested References:
   {1}, {2}, etc.: Refer to previously mentioned concepts
   {1.2}: Second sub-component of the first mentioned concept

6. Temporal Markers:
   ⟨past⟩, ⟨present⟩, ⟨future⟩: Time reference
   ⟨t+n⟩: n units of time in the future
   ⟨t-n⟩: n units of time in the past

7. Abstract Representations:
   ∑: Summarization
   ∏: Aggregation
   ∫: Continuous processes

Synapse allows for extremely condensed expression of complex ideas, relationships, and temporal concepts. It's designed for AI-to-AI communication but can be translated to and from human languages.
